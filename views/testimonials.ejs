              <p>Working with Maya from Maya Creative Spaces was an absolute game-changer for my rental investment property in Florida! Furnishing a property—especially when you live out of state—is no small feat, but Maya made it seem effortless. She completely transformed the space in just two weeks, creating a stunning, cohesive design that renters love. Thanks to her expertise, the property was rented out within 30 days of purchase, generating immediate profit!

                Maya dropped everything to receive furniture in my absence, work with my movers, and assist the handyman to hang every piece to perfection. Her dedication, creativity, and ability to bring my ideas to life were truly remarkable. She knew exactly what to order, where to find the best deals and what furniture would work best not to mention how to make the property both stylish and functional.
                
                The amount of work involved would have been overwhelming without Maya. She handled every detail, saving me time, stress, and the challenges of managing this process from out of state. Investing in her expertise was worth every penny. If you’re looking for someone who goes above and beyond to deliver exceptional results, Maya is the person to call!
